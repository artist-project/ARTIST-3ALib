the client is using only the AvailabilityAuditor, by inserting keys, provider and service name


Abstractions: interface for all specific auditors that need to implement it
AbsrtactedGetserver: get computeservice object, handle differently per provider (different type of information needed)

README: status may be achieved through pinging

to enable pinging, one must implement the following actions:

a) AWS: change in the security group of the VM instances the rules to include allowing of ICMP traffic
in case we need to enable it also in the VMs we may issue the following command:
 sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
 
 
 
b) different OS versions taken under consideration (command is different in Windows and Linux)

c) Decision is  based on Average reported value. By default, ping function has average if even 1 sample 
gets through. We consider the same condition. 


d) Pinging is decided in common with the pinging of 8.8.8.8, to ensure general connectivity of the client


e) Changing the way we implement reachability decision needs a new class that implements the DecideReachability
interface (and replacement in the class that the reachability decision is called)
