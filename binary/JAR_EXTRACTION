
In order to extract it without maven, for this version that is using only AWS, we can

1) export as jar the content of the two projects aws-ec2 and jclouds-core.

2) Add jar to build path of Auditor

3) Export running jar from Auditor (potentially with jars in separate folder for licensing issues)
